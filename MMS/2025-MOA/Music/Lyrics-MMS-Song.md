(A lively anthem celebrating the Midwest Management Summit at Mall of America and its amazing sponsors)  
(Verse 1)
Down in Minnesota, where the techies all convene,
MMSMOA’s the summit, it’s the IT dream scene.
At the Radisson Blu, by the Mall of America’s glow,
Systems management pros come to learn and grow.
Task sequences, ConfigMgr, Intune in the air,
With expert speakers sharin’ knowledge everywhere.
From deep-dive sessions to the tips and tricks we crave,
MMSMOA’s the place where IT pros are brave.  
The welcome reception’s poppin’ on a Sunday night,
Networking with MVPs, yeah, the vibe’s just right.
No formal closin’ party, but the sponsors bring the fun,
Booth parties, happy hours, ‘til the night is done.
With a hundred sessions, from level 100 to 500 deep,
We’re geekin’ out on endpoints, no time for sleep.
Midwest Management Summit, you’re the heart of the game,
MMSMOA, we’re shoutin’ your name!  
(Chorus)
Oh, MMSMOA Groove, you light up the tech world bright,
Four days of learnin’, networkin’ through the night.
With sponsors like 1E, NiCE, and Kelverion too,
They’re powerin’ the summit, makin’ dreams come true.
From the Mall of America to the sessions we roam,
MMSMOA, you feel like home.
Groove to the rhythm of the IT flow,
MMSMOA, let’s go, let’s go!  
(Verse 2)
Let’s give a shout to 1E, they’re the endpoint kings,
Tachyon’s real-time magic, fixin’ all the things.
At their booth, it’s a party, with swag and a grin,
Windows Servicing Suite, helpin’ IT pros win.
From WannaCry battles to DEX insights they share,
1E’s at MMSMOA, showin’ they care.
Their SMAAASH party’s epic, with laser tag and cheers,
Sponsors like 1E make memories for years.  

NiCE and Kelverion, they’re the SCOM/SCORCH crew,
Automated monitoring, makin’ IT dreams come true.
Live demos at their booth, showin’ best practices clear,
With expert talks and insights, they’re the ones we cheer.
From infrastructure challenges to solutions that shine,
NiCE and Kelverion keep our systems in line.
At MMSMOA, their passion’s on display,
Sponsors liftin’ us up in every way.  

(Chorus)
Oh, MMSMOA Groove, you light up the tech world bright,
Four days of learnin’, networkin’ through the night.
With sponsors like 1E, NiCE, and Kelverion too,
They’re powerin’ the summit, makin’ dreams come true.
From the Mall of America to the sessions we roam,
MMSMOA, you feel like home.
Groove to the rhythm of the IT flow,
MMSMOA, let’s go, let’s go!  
(Bridge)
Cyber Advisors in the mix, with their tech know-how,
Bloggin’ ‘bout the summit, keepin’ us wowed.  

Community-driven, capped at 750 strong,
Intimate and focused, where we all belong.
Beer sessions at five, with a happy hour vibe,
SharTips and NoF, where ideas come alive.
Microsoft product teams, they’re joinin’ the fray,
Feedback loops at MMS, improvin’ every day.  

Sponsors throw the parties, from go-karts to brews,
Networkin’ with peers, sharin’ IT views.
They fund the swag, like jackets for the cold,
Light and comfy, keepin’ us bold.  

From Power BI to Intune, we’re learnin’ it all,
Thanks to sponsors’ support, we answer the call.
MMSMOA’s a family, a techie retreat,
With sponsors and pros, the groove’s complete.  
(Verse 3)
The Mall’s right next door, with attractions galore,
But the real thrill’s the knowledge we explore.
Red-jacket speakers, like Garth Jones and Dave,
Droppin’ ConfigMgr wisdom, makin’ us brave.  

Camping sessions, one-on-one with the best,
Solvin’ real-world problems, puttin’ skills to the test.
From OSD to autopilot, we’re pushin’ the edge,
MMSMOA’s the spark for our IT pledge.  
Sponsors keep it rollin’, with their booths full of flair,
Demos, prizes, and passion they share.
They’re not just vendors, they’re part of the crew,
Buildin’ the future with the MMS crew.
From early bird tickets to the final day’s cheer,
The summit’s affordable, knowledge crystal clear.
MMSMOA, you’re the beat of our heart,
With sponsors and tech, we’ll never part.  
(Chorus)
Oh, MMSMOA Groove, you light up the tech world bright,
Four days of learnin’, networkin’ through the night.
With sponsors like 1E, NiCE, and Kelverion too,
They’re powerin’ the summit, makin’ dreams come true.
From the Mall of America to the sessions we roam,
MMSMOA, you feel like home.
Groove to the rhythm of the IT flow,
MMSMOA, let’s go, let’s go!  
(Outro)
So raise a glass to MMS, where the techies unite,
From the sessions to the parties, we’re geekin’ with delight.
Sponsors like 1E, NiCE, and Cyber’s crew,
Kelverion and more, we’re thankin’ you.
Midwest Management Summit, you’re the place to be,
MMSMOA, you’re the groove for me.
Let’s dance to the rhythm of the IT flow,
MMSMOA, forever, let’s go!
