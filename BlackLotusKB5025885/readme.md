# KB5025885  - Black Lotus

I'll be keeping this updated with latest scripts for both ConfigMgr Configuration Items (CIs) and for Intune Remediation Scripts.  I'll also keep other useful scripts here.

I'll plan to create a change log, which will be listed on this page, once I get there.

Things are working, but I need to do a rewrite based on the May 5, 2025 changes Microsoft released.  The current scripts are based on the 2 reboots per step, which has now changed.  You can use them, but I will be updating soon... so stay tuned.
